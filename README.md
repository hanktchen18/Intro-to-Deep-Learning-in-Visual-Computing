# Intro-to-Deep-Learning-in-Visual-Computing

A comprehensive series covering the fundamentals of deep learning for visual computing applications. This repository contains six progressive modules that build from basic machine learning concepts to advanced neural network architectures:

**Linear Regression & Binary Classification** - Foundational machine learning techniques
**Multi-Category Neural Networks** - Extended classification capabilities
**Neural Network Optimization Techniques** - Methods to improve training and performance
**Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch** - CNN implementation for image processing
**GANs for MNIST Dataset** - Generative Adversarial Networks for digit generation
**Domain Adaptation (SVHN to MNIST)** - Transfer learning between different visual domains

Each module is provided as a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises to help learners master deep learning concepts in the context of visual data processing.
