# Intro-to-Deep-Learning-in-Visual-Computing
A comprehensive tutorial series covering the fundamentals of deep learning for visual computing applications. This repository contains six progressive modules that build from basic machine learning concepts to advanced neural network architectures.

## ðŸ“š Course Modules
1. **Linear Regression & Binary Classification**: Foundational machine learning techniques
2. **Multi-Category Neural Networks**: Extended classification capabilities
3. **Neural Network Optimization Techniques**: Methods to improve training and performance
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch**: CNN implementation for image processing
5. **GANs for MNIST Dataset**: Generative Adversarial Networks for digit generation
6. **Domain Adaptation (SVHN to MNIST)**: Transfer learning between different visual domains

Each module is provided as a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises to help learners master deep learning concepts in the context of visual data processing.
